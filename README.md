# adblock-blocker
## A website with the sole intention of blocking adblockers. 
Yes, you read that correctly, script.js will detect the adblockers and create an element on the screen blocking users from accessing the website. also some annoying background music + flashing of text will occur as well. 

## If they try to inspect + delete the element... 
the script will punish the user by opening up multiple windows on the screen and moving them around. Try to delete the windows and it'll spawn new ones.
